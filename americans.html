house of a bicameral body.The new 80-member Philippine Assembly was directly elected by a restricted electorate from 
single-member districts, makingit the first elective legislative body in Southeast Asia.In 1925, the only American left in the gov.-gen.'s
cabinet was the secretary of public instruction, who was also the lieutenant governor-general. In the initial years of United States rule, hundreds of school teachers
came from the United States. But Filipino teachers were rapidly trained that by 1927 they constitued nearly all 26,200 teachers in public schools.</br>
